# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-gtsrb
This project focuses on Traffic Sign Recognition using machine learning models. The goal is to recognize and classify traffic signs into different categories. We explore various models and techniques for this task, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Transfer Learning with Inception, and Regularized CNN.
